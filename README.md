# gtmarket

This package is a collection of tools that I use for working with
gtm data.  It is part of my daily workflow, and I don't mind others
poking around and copying the code, but it's not really intended for
public comsumption.  I don't want to be bothered with documenting
any more than I myself will need to remember how to use it.  

Consider this a super unstable package that is subject to breaking
changes at any moment.
